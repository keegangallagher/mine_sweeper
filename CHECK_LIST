This will be a check list for things that we need to complete for the project. As you find things to add, add them in this list with a description of what the change would look like. Add and remove items as problems are solved / encountered. Add your name next to whatever youre planning to work on. 

***List is not in order of urgency.***

1. Different modes 
    - Add different difficulties (board size and bomb amount)
    Can easily change board size and number of bombs to create diffrent dificulty modes, only thing that will need to be manualy changed are the letters in the is_colom function and the letters in the board_two function

2. one input instead of 3 could be better cause right now you have to hit enter 3 times, might be better to put in input like 3 b f that way its quicker and easier 
    -doing this would just take looking at the user function and changeing the top part of it a little so that it's one input and it uses the split function to then get the three values that it checks. the rest of that function should be uninfluenced 

3. Board design
    I think we could do some things to make the board easier to see and understand, maybe we could space the board more or even
    color code numbers or flags to help ease of use. 

4. How the game ends and bomb number.
    As of now the game ends if you flag all the bombs but maybe we should make the game end once every tile that isnt a bomb
    is selected, the game ends, like normal minesweeper.
