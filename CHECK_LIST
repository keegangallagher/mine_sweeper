This will be a check list for things that we need to complete for the project. As you find things to add, add them in this list with a description of what the change would look like. Add and remove items as problems are solved / encountered. Add your name next to whatever youre planning to work on. 

***List is not in order of urgency.***
1. Input to new number by number in the board. So instead of letters it just has to accept another int again. maybe the input for the game asks like (x,y,action) 

2. one input instead of 3 could be better cause right now you have to hit enter 3 times, might be better to put in input like 3 b f that way its quicker and easier 
    -doing this would just take looking at the user function and changeing the top part of it a little so that it's one input and it uses the split function to then get the three values that it checks. the rest of that function should be uninfluenced 
    -need to be manualy changed are the letters in the is_colom function and the letters in the board_two function

3. Color Coded.
    Make the numbers colored for ease of use and to make it easier to see and understand the game board.

4. How the game ends.
    As of now the game ends if you flag all the bombs but maybe we should make the game end once every tile that isnt a bomb
    is selected, the game ends, like normal minesweeper.
