#we have a seperate file that has a random list of bombs and numbers that is going to be attatched to this one to use in the boxes on the gameboard
#we plan to have a list generated with all the bomb locations and then a second list which is whats been revealed and where the user wants flags

def flag(): #this function is used to mark on the board where the user thinks bombs are
  
def game_board(size): #the gameboad will be a grid with numbers on the side and boxes with the numbers or flags inside


def main():
  gameboard() #calls gameboard
main()
